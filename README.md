Hosts example code for Year12 Computing :P

Look under "Sample/" for "Program.cs" - that's the demo file.
If you open it then hit "Raw", it'll show you the raw file. You can then right click->download to save the .cs file :P
Then either make a new project and include it or just open it in visual studio.

You can also hit "Download as .zip" when at the root page to d/l the entire project if you can't be bothered to make a new project just for this one file :P
